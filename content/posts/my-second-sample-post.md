# The Art of Sourdough: A Baker's Guide

Making sourdough bread is both a science and an art. It requires patience, practice, and understanding of the fermentation process.

## The Starter

Your sourdough starter is a living ecosystem of wild yeast and bacteria. Here's how to maintain it:

* Feed it regularly
* Keep it at room temperature
* Monitor its activity
* Notice the smell and appearance

### Feeding Schedule

```plaintext
Morning Feed:
- 100g starter
- 100g flour
- 100g water

Evening Feed:
- Discard all but 50g
- Add 50g flour
- Add 50g water
```

## The Basic Recipe

> "Time and temperature are your most important ingredients." - Chad Robertson

### Ingredients

- 500g bread flour
- 350g water
- 100g active starter
- 10g salt

## The Process

1. **Autolyse**: Mix flour and water
2. **Bulk Fermentation**: 4-6 hours
3. **Shaping**: Create tension
4. **Final Proof**: 12-14 hours
5. **Baking**: High heat, steam

### Troubleshooting Common Issues

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Dense crumb | Under-fermented | Extend bulk time |
| Too sour | Over-fermented | Reduce proof time |
| Poor rise | Weak starter | Feed starter more |
